This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `greeter` function expects a string argument but receives an array of strings.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this by either modifying the function's signature or destructuring the array to pass in the correct type.  This illustrates the importance of paying close attention to TypeScript's type system.
